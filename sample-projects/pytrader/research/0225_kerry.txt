first place i'd look at with a trader is 
* sentiment analysis
* arbitrage opportunities
classifier on buy or sell, as opposed to neural network. eventually that gets me to buy/sell/hold.
    different styles of classifiers, some are good at prettymuch antying you throw at them
NN is invalid if training / predicting on same data point
    you can overfit to the data
    validate on a selection of data that you'll have when im running the trading engine
    delta between training and validation could be a config parameter (or should i just train on the whole week)
ask greg for intro to dan / victorops


TLDR -- would look at classifier instead of NN
    classifiers can output confidence intervals
